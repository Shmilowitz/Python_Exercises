    "## Unit Tests and Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `unittest` from the Python standard library provides tools for testing your code. A *unit test* verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s behavior is correct. A *test case* is a collection of unit tests that together prove that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full range of situations you expect it to handle. A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function could receive and includes tests to represent each of these situations. A test case with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests covering all the possible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large project can be daunting. It is often good enough to write tests for your code’s critical behaviors and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see widespread use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Passing Test\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a test case for a function, import the `unittest` module and the function you want to test. Then create a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, and write a series of methods to test different aspects of your function’s behavior.\n",

When you include a `setUp()` method in a test class, Python runs it before running each method starting with `test_`. Any objects created in the `setUp()` method are available througout your test class.
